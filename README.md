# Covid-19 Dashboard
The Covid-19 Dashboard is a simple dashboard that keeps track of Covid-19 confirmed cases, deaths, and trends using data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

## Motivation
I wanted to get more practice working with data and building dashboards. This is something that I use to stay informed.

## Libraries used
```
library(httr)
library(tidyverse)
library(flexdashboard)
library(DT)
library(tibbletime)
library(RCurl)
library(plotly)
library(readxl)
library(broman)
```
## Current Status
The project isn't live. I have included a screenshot below of what the home page currently looks like.
